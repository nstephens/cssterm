## Substitution

  The following replacements will be made if found at the beginning of a line:
  
  - `lines that start with "#" will be treated as a root command`
  - `lines that start with "!" will be replaced as a comment`
  - `include line breaks by placing a space (" ") on an empty line`
  - `everything else treated as standard output`

##ToDo

1. Testing.. Testing.. Testing..
